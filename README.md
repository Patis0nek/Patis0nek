# **Front-End Developer** with **React.js** and **UX/UI Expertise**

ðŸ‘‹ I am a front-end developer and UX/UI designer with a passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites using React.js. My expertise in these areas allows me to design and develop websites that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional.

ðŸŽ¨ I enjoy making creative stuff. My intrest in designing started back in 2019 when a friend of mine suggested posting school's newspaper. Later, during lockdown in 2020 I discovered how incredible programming is, so connecting these skills I started making websites.

ðŸŽ“ Currently, I'm a high school student in Bielsko-BiaÅ‚a, Poland. During our IT programming lessons we mainly focus on C++, but I use my free time to work on various self-development projects at home.

ðŸŒŸ I believe that developing my skills and interests together is essential to reaching my objectives and maximizing my potential. Here are a few things I love doing: solving Rubik's cubes, practicing chess tactics, snowboarding, listening to science podcasts, learning about aerospace engineering.
