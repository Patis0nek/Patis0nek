# **Front-End Developer** with **React.js** and **UX/UI Expertise**

ðŸ‘‹ I am a **front-end developer** and **UX/UI designer** with a passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites using **React.js**. My expertise in these areas allows me to **design** and **develop websites** that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional.

ðŸŽ¨ I enjoy making **creative stuff**. My intrest in designing started back in 2019 when a friend of mine suggested posting school's newspaper. Later, during lockdown in 2020 I discovered how incredible programming is, so connecting these skills I started making websites.

ðŸŽ“ Currently, I'm a high school student in Bielsko-BiaÅ‚a, Poland. During our IT programming lessons we mainly focus on C++, but I use my free time to work on various **self-development** projects at home.

ðŸŒŸ I believe that **developing my skills** and interests together is essential to reaching my objectives and maximizing my potential. Here are a few things I love doing: solving Rubik's cubes, chess tactics, snowboarding, listening to science podcasts, aerospace engineering.
